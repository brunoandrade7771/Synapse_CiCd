<h1>Implementation of CI/CD Pipeline (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery)
</h1> <p align="justify">CI/CD is a comprehensive term that covers various phases of DevOps. CI (Continuous Integration) is the practice of integrating code changes into a repository multiple times a day. CD has two meanings: Continuous Delivery automates code integrations,
while Continuous Deployment automatically releases final builds to end users. Frequent CI/CD testing reduces errors and code defects, making them essential for any workflow.</p>

## Overview
<p align="justify">The implementation of the CI/CD pipeline is necessary to streamline and standardize the structure of your environment, ensuring the quality of code from the development environment to its implementation in the production environment, which is done automatically after the approval of artifacts. This document contains the procedure to implement this CI/CD structure using Github Actions and the Azure environment.</p>
